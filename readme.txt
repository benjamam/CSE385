In order to have full functionality of this code you must:

*Have XAMPP installed
*Create a database called "test"
*Create a table called "users"
*Insert tuples into "users"
*Only these tuples will be able to log into our system

*In addition, you will need to change line 5 of welcome.php to your own local root password of mySQL. The default password is 
blank

*With that said, you can style the pages and see general functionality without doing any of these things
